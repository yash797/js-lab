Over the past year, I have contributed to several key initiatives such as Carbon Migration, MQ V9 Update, AAF API Onboarding (Agora Portal), UKPB Entitlement Enhancements, and multiple API Migrations. My work has involved end-to-end ownership across development, testing, and release activities, ensuring all deliverables were completed on time with strong focus on quality, compliance, and reliability.
Below is a brief summary of my key contributions and achievements aligned with the goals defined for this review period.

Risk & Compliance (Mandatory)

- Completed all mandatory trainings on time and consistently applied HSBC’s risk and control framework.

- Earned White & Yellow Belt certifications and cleared SHL exam, improving awareness around compliance and operational excellence.

- Ensured all deliveries met secure coding, peer review, and deployment standards — no compliance breaches reported.

- Followed proper Jira and GitHub hygiene, maintaining full audit traceability for all CRs and releases.

- Used GitHub Copilot to maintain code consistency and improve CODEGA quality metrics.

- Proactively identified and escalated potential risks early, especially during major activities like Carbon Migration and MQ V9 Update.


Customer Experience

- Worked on multiple initiatives improving customer reliability and data safety across payments.

- Enabled delegate payments for UKPB customers (in LP testing), allowing delegates to make secure payments on behalf of primary users.

- Migrated Carbon SAPIs to production and shifted APIs to SHP for better performance and reduced downtime.

- Implemented secure parameter passing for all UK APIs to protect customer data.

- Strengthened AAF integration for SAPIs to improve authentication and authorization for both delegate and main customers.

- Ensured post-deployment monitoring to avoid any customer-facing issues after go-live.

Safer

- Delivered over 75+ CRs (including child CRs) to production with zero failures or customer impact.

- Used canary deployments to safely roll out releases and minimize risk during migrations.

- Released new API versions supporting smarter routing and reduced blast radius on potential failures.

- Partnered with business testers to validate features before production rollout, ensuring safer releases.

- Maintained stable production health across all releases, with no P1/P2 incidents.

- Proactively monitored via Splunk and ROTA dashboards to detect and resolve any emerging issues quickly.

Leaner

- Simplified and optimized Java code to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

- Reduced code smells across ~20 repositories and improved CODEGA scores through cleanup and reviews.

- Reused components and templates to streamline development and avoid duplication.

- Improved release documentation and followed formal change controls for every CR.

- Worked closely with QA to ensure efficient testing and faster defect turnaround.

- Supported cost-saving initiatives by improving resource efficiency and process automation.

- Helped new joiners with environment setup, KT sessions, and overall understanding of the project across multiple PODs, ensuring faster onboarding and team alignment.

Faster

- Supported ~75+ production releases this year, covering: Carbon Migration, MQ V9 Update, AAF Onboarding, SHP Migration, DSVC→DMST migration, RPS ZAPI update, and UKPB entitlement changes.

- Followed Mode 2 practices and delivered all major changes on time with quality and control compliance.

- Played a key role in PI Planning and sprint delivery, maintaining strong DoD adherence and documentation hygiene.

- Achieved >85% on-time delivery of PI commitments and supported stretch targets through collaboration and early risk identification.

- Actively worked across teams to remove dependencies and accelerate delivery pace.

AWS Associate Certification

- Currently preparing for AWS Certified Developer – Associate certification.

- Completed Udemy course and hands-on labs to strengthen understanding of Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and CloudWatch.

- Applying cloud concepts to ongoing API design and deployment optimization.

- Targeting certification in the next quarter to contribute more effectively to HSBC’s cloud transformation goals.

GitHub Copilot & Automation Test Suites

- Leveraged GitHub Copilot daily to improve development speed and accuracy.

- Achieved 100% unit test coverage for targeted APIs and ensured automation scripts remained in sync with latest code.

- Added security validation in unit tests to detect vulnerabilities early.

- Maintained low defect leakage and improved testing confidence across releases.

Delivery Commitments (PI Planning)

- Completed all PI deliverables within planned timelines while maintaining code quality and compliance.

- Collaborated closely with DevOps, QA, and stakeholders to ensure smooth end-to-end delivery.

- Supported dependency management and cross-team blockers proactively.

- Ensured Definition of Done (DoD) was consistently met — including reviews, tests, and documentation.

- Actively participated in retrospectives to identify and act on improvement areas for upcoming PIs.


Overall Summary (HSBC Values in Action)

We get it done:
Delivered multiple high-impact programs (Carbon Migration, MQ V9, AAF Onboarding, UKPB) on time and without incidents, maintaining focus on quality and control.

We value difference:
Collaborated with diverse teams across pods and functions, shared learnings, and adopted best practices to deliver better outcomes.

We take responsibility:
Took complete ownership of development through to deployment, ensuring risk, quality, and documentation standards were met consistently.

We succeed together:
Actively supported teammates during critical releases and troubleshooting sessions, while also helping new joiners with setup, KT sessions, and overall project understanding across multiple PODs to ensure smooth collaboration and faster onboarding.


Development Focus for Next Year
